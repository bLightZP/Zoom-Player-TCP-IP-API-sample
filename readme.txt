 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *** Introduction:
 Zoom Player supports multiple Command & Control interfaces:
 
 1. TCP/IP based Command and Control.
    Allows Command and Control of Zoom Player over an Internet or Intranet connection with full notification of the
    player's state.
    
 2. Inter-Process Win32 API Bi-Directional Command and Control.
    An external application registers its window with Zoom Player by calling a specially crafted WinAPI "SendMessage"
    command.  Once the application window is registered, the application can send Zoom Player control commands using
    the "SendMessage" WinAPI command and receive messages by capturing a special WinAPI message generated by
    Zoom Player and sent to the registered Window.
 
 3. Simplified Inter-Process Win32 Control.
    A subset of commands that provide easy control over a limited subset of Zoom Player features.

 4. Command Line Interface.
    Control Zoom Player through the command line, requiring no programming experience whatsoever.



 *** TCP/IP based Command and Control:
 To use the TCP/IP interface, you must first enable it in the options dialog under "Advanced Options / System".
 The default TCP/IP port is "4769", this value can be altered on the same options dialog page.
  
 When using the TCP/IP interface, the event number is always sent and returned as a 4-digit code followed by the
 event's content (when applicable).  All content is string based and UTF-8 encoded to preserve country specific
 character codes.

 When sending TCP/IP commands, make sure to terminate each command with CRLF (ASCII #13#10).



 *** Inter-Process Win32 API Bi-Directional Command and Control:
 To register your application with Zoom Player, send Zoom Player (using the WinAPI "SendMessage" function) an
 ATOM String containing your application's window name and the following parameters (in the "SendMessage" function):

 WParam         : ATOM String value created using the WinAPI "GlobalAddAtom" function.
 LParam         : A value of "200" indicating that your application is trying to register itself.
 Message Number : WM_APP + 49.
 
 Your application must now capture the "WM_APP+444" WinAPI message which Zoom Player uses to send information to
 your application's window.  When Zoom Player notifies your application, the Zoom Player API event number (see below)
 is returned in the "WParam" value and the message content is returned in the "LParam" value.
 
 If the LParam value contain a string, it is stored as an ATOM String which your application must free using the
 WinAPI "GlobalDeleteAtom" function.

                                        Value is play rate multiplied by 1000.  For example:
                                        A value of "1500" means a play rate of "1.5".
                                        If you call a function and get this message with the
                                        play rate value unchanged, it means the function failed

                                        Value is an integer representing the play rate multiplied
                                        by 1000.  For example a value of "500" means a play rate of "0.5".
                                        Do not use negative values in media mode, it will not work.
                                        Fast Play in media mode has a speed restriction a bit over "2.0"
                                        unless Reclock is used as the audio renderer (this is a microsoft
                                        limitation due to sound driver architecture).

                                        This message requires three UTF8 encoded text string parameters.
                                        The first parameter indicates a unique identifier which is returned
                                        to you in the callback message, which will help you identify which
                                        message prompted the user for input.
                                        The second parameter populates the text entry field with the specified
                                        text (you can leave this empty if you want an empty text input value.
                                        The third parameter is used to query the user for the type of input
                                        required.
                                        For example:
                                        "4000 eMail||Enter your eMail address"
                                        or to include an existing text:
                                        "4000 eMail|no@one.org|Enter your eMail address"
                                        The result is returned in a 4000 message indicating failure/success,
                                        the unique identfier and the text entered.  The entered text is returned
                                        even in the case where the user selected to cancel the operation.

                                        if a path is specified, the content of the path (under the shared folder)
                                        is returned.  Please note that for security reasons, paths can't begin with
                                        the ".", "/" or "\" character and may not include any invalid character in
                                        the path's body (such as "|").
                                        For Example:
                                        "6000 TV\Wednesday\"
                                        If the "/SharePath" parameter is not specified, an empty message is returned.
 6010 - Add Shared files to Playlist  | Accept a list of file names separated by the "|" characters as the new playlist.
                                        The file names are appended to the end of the playlist and a 6010 message is fired
                                        off to ackknowledge that processing has ended.
                                        The 'SharePath' value is automatically added to the path of each file.
                                        For example:
                                        "6010 MyVideo.avi|MP3\MyAudio.mp3"
                                        With this example and 'SharePath' specified as "/SharePath:X:\Content\",
                                        Zoom Player will add the files to the playlist as:
                                        X:\Content\MyVideo.avi
                                        X:\Content\MP3\MyAudio.mp3

 

 *** Simplified Inter-Process Win32 Control:

 Use the WinAPI "SendMessage" command to send Zoom Player a control command.  The values listed below are passed
 in the "LParam" field (the values are in HEX).
 
 The return value of the event contains an integer value with the current state (with the exception of
 "ZP_GetFileName" which returns an ATOM string containing the file name (make sure to deallocate the atom string).

   [ WinAPI Message Number : WM_APP + 50 ]
   ZP_GetFileName       = 0x1000; // Returns the Currently Playing file name
   ZP_GetDuration       = 0x1010; // Returns the playing media length
   ZP_GetPosition       = 0x1020; // Returns the current play position
   ZP_GetMode           = 0x1030; // Returns the current Play Mode (DVD, Media or Audio)
   ZP_GetState          = 0x1040; // Retruns the current Play State (Closed, Stopped, Paused, Playing)
   ZP_GetPlayIndex      = 0x1050; // Returns the current (Playlist) Playing Item Index
   ZP_VolumeLevel       = 0x1060; // Returns the current Audio Volume Level
   ZP_SetPosition       = 0x5000; // Set current position (WParam specifies the value in Seconds)
   ZP_CallFunction      = 0x5010; // Call a Zoom Player function (WParam contains an ATOM string listing
                                  // the function name).  The Function Names can be found here:
                                  // http://inmatrix.com/zplayer/highlights/zpfunctions.shtml
   ZP_CallExFunction    = 0x5020; // Call a Zoom Player extended function (WParam is an ATOM string listing the
                                  // extended function name
                                  // The string should be listed as "[function],[value]", for example:
                                  // "exSetAR,2" (don't include the "" in the string)

   [ WinAPI Message Number : WM_APP + 49 ]
   ZP_CallFunctionIndex = 0x0000; // WParam holds a specific function number 
                                  // The Function Numbers can be found here:
                                  // http://inmatrix.com/zplayer/highlights/zpfunctions.shtml
   ZP_ScanCode          = 0x0001; // WParam holds a keyboard scancode
   ZP_AltScanCode       = 0x0002; // WParam holds a keyboard scancode with ALT pressed
   ZP_CtrlScanCode      = 0x0003; // WParam holds a keyboard scancode with CTRL pressed
   ZP_ShiftScanCode     = 0x0004; // WParam holds a keyboard scancode with SHIFT pressed
   ZP_AltShiftScanCode  = 0x0005; // WParam holds a keyboard scancode with ALT+SHIFT pressed
   ZP_AltCtrlScanCode   = 0x0006; // WParam holds a keyboard scancode with ALT+CTRL pressed
   ZP_CtrlShiftScanCode = 0x0007; // WParam holds a keyboard scancode with CTRL+SHIFT pressed
   ZP_ASCScanCode       = 0x0008; // WParam holds a keyboard scancode with ALT+SHIFT+CTRL pressed

                                  // 0 = Mouse Middle Button Click
                                  // 1 = Mouse Wheel Up
                                  // 2 = Mouse Wheel Down

 Some functions require you to pass an ATOM string to Zoom Player.  Use the WinAPI "GlobalAddAtom" function to create
 the ATOM and pass it through the WParam parameter.  Zoom Player will clear any ATOM string it receives.
                                
                                

 *** Using the Command Line Interface:
 The Zoom Player command line interface is quite powerful and allows you to control the action without any
 programming experience.
 
 Some parameters can be used even if Zoom Player is already running as long as you are not running multiple instances
 of the player (other parameters only have an affect on the initial run).
